## pg_listen: trigger a shell command on a Postgres event

Super fast and lightweight. Written in C using libpq.

### Usage

```bash
pg_listen postgres://db-uri channel [/path/to/program] [args]

# for example, to note when NOTIFY happened on "hello" channel
# pg_listen postgres://localhost/postgres hello /bin/echo they said hi

# print payload from the channel
# (default action when no command is specified)
# pg_listen postgres://localhost/postgres fun
```

Note that pg\_listen line-buffers its output, so the payload raised by NOTIFY
needs to include a final newline ("\n"). The program won't output anything
until a newline is encountered.

```sql
-- incorrect
NOTIFY foo, 'hi';

-- correct
NOTIFY foo, E'hi\n';
```

### Building

Just clone the repo and run `make`. The makefile is compatible with BSD and GNU
Make and requires only that libpq be installed on the system.

If you use NixOS you can run `nix-shell` to build it.

If you installed PostgreSQL on Mac using homebrew or Macports, note that
pkg-config is not installed by default and needs to be installed by running
`brew install pkg-config` prior to running `make`. Additionally you may need to
update `$PKG_CONFIG_PATH` and add the directory containing `libpq.pc` for your
system.
